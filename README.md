All inventories are supported, but explicit support has been completed for:

FAQ:

  - No. You get it for free
  
- Will you add a 3x3 crafting grid inside the player inventory?
  - Nope
  
- Will any version passed 1.7.10 be supported?
  - What are you talking about? 1.7.10 ***is*** the latest version of Minecraft
